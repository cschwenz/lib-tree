Revision history for lib-tree

0.04    2010-03-09/11:17 pm EST
        * Fixed two bugs reported by 'cmccutch' (one in the _script_dir()
          function of lib::tree and the other in the create_test_lib_tree()
          function of .../t/TestUtils.pm).
        * Removed the dependency on File::Spec::Functions.  All File::Spec calls
          are now called using the $FS->method() syntax, where $FS is an 'our'
          value defined at the beginning of lib::tree.  This means you can
          explicitly tell lib::tree which flavour of File::Spec you want it to
          use (the $FS variable defaults to 'File::Spec').
        * The change to using the $FS->method() syntax necessitated moving three
          functions into a BEGIN block near the top of the .../lib/tree.pm file.
        * Adding the .../inc/ directory to aid with clean Module::Install
          installs on systems which do not have Module::Install present.
